- Steve Dekorte invented the Io language in 2002
- Io is a prototype language like Javascript(every object is a clone of another)
- Everything in Io is an object(lists, strings, files even messages!!)
- Prototype-based is a style of OOP in which behaviour re-use(inheritance) is performed
via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes
- Io knows nothing about classes. A prototype is both a class and an instance
- To get a new instance you just clone an existing prototype

```Io
"Hello World" print
```
// The "Hello World" object - which happens to be a string - is being sent the message print.   
// Receivers go on the left and messages on the right
